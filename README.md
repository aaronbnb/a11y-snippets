# Accessibility Code Snippets
These snippets help with accessibility testing and understanding the experience a website provides for assistive technology users:

Execute the following code snippets either in the browser’s built-in JavaScript console or as a JavaScript bookmarklet. 

Some are currently written as functions to be pasted into the console while others are intended to be JavaScript bookmarklets.
-	Visualize screen reader user experience – strips presentational CSS, applies minimalist styling, and displays text alternatives rather than graphical content
-	Detect if a webpage contains Shadow DOM content
-	Generate a 5 second window before pausing script execution and opening the debugger
-	Add keyboard operability to an element
-	Adds a roving tabindex to a group of elements

### Note
When using a function in the built-in JavaScript console, be sure to first initialize the function in the console, then execute the function.
